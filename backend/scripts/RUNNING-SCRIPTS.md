# Running Scripts

**Important:** Donâ€™t forget to create the appropriate environment files (e.g. `.Development.env`, `.Production.env`, etc.) inside the `config` folder before running the scripts.

**Important:** All scripts should be run from the `server` directory.

For example, in a **bash terminal** or any compatible shell, run one of the scripts located in the `scripts` folder, such as:

```bash
./scripts/build-and-run-development.sh
```
